Tell me your type, so I can get to know you
So that our hearts can be touched
So that our hands can be touched
You can rest up in my chest uh uh uh

The seat next to you is NANANA
The one who can make you smile is NANANA
I‚Äôm feeling good NANANA
I want to know everything

Oh eh oh oh eh oh

Just smiling for no reason
Slowly we are getting closer
My heart is like a racing horse on a taxi meter
I know it‚Äôs frustrating, but blessed are those who endure, ay

We talk about us just naturally
including a bit of naughty talks
Open up all the roads and remove the lines
I know it‚Äôs a bit mischievous, but we like it like that

The seat next to you is NANANA
The one who can make you smile is NANANA
I‚Äôm feeling good NANANA
I want to know everything

Oh eh oh oh eh oh
Oh eh oh oh eh oh

I think we are thinking the same way
Why are you hesitating
It‚Äôs okay to open up your mind

I want to know everything about you
Tell me everything, even the small things, too

The seat next to you is NANANA
The one who can make you smile is NANANA
I‚Äôm feeling good NANANA
I want to know everything

I‚Äôve got a message message
‚ÄúI‚Äôm bored‚Äù just saying
My hands are busy busy
So that our conversations won‚Äôt dry up

I want to be fitted to you from up and down
Tell me your type, so I can get to know you
So that our hearts can be touched
So that our hands can be touched
You can rest up in my chest uh uh uh

The seat next to you is NANANA
The one who can make you smile is NANANA
I‚Äôm feeling good NANANA
I want to know everything

Oh eh oh oh eh oh
Oh eh oh oh eh oh

Just smiling for no reason
Slowly we are getting closer
My heart is like a racing horse on a taxi meter
I know it‚Äôs frustrating, but blessed are those who endure, ay

We talk about us just naturally
including a bit of naughty talks
Open up all the roads and remove the lines
I know it‚Äôs a bit mischievous, but we like it like that

The seat next to you is NANANA
The one who can make you smile is NANANA
I‚Äôm feeling good NANANA
I want to know everything

Oh eh oh oh eh oh
Oh eh oh oh eh oh

I think we are thinking the same way
Why are you hesitating
It‚Äôs okay to open up your mind

I want to know everything about you
Tell me everything, even the small things, too

The seat next to you is NANANA
The one who can make you smile is NANANA
I‚Äôm feeling good NANANA
I want to know everything

Oh eh oh oh eh oh
Oh eh oh oh eh oh

ELVIS is an epic, big-screen spectacle from Warner Bros. Pictures and visionary, Oscar-nominated filmmaker Baz Luhrmann that explores the life and music of Elvis Presley, starring Austin Butler and Oscar winner Tom Hanks. 

A thoroughly cinematic drama, Elvis‚Äôs (Butler) story is seen through the prism of his complicated relationship with his enigmatic manager, Colonel Tom Parker (Hanks). As told by Parker, the film delves into the complex dynamic between the two spanning over 20 years, from Presley‚Äôs rise to fame to his unprecedented stardom, against the backdrop of the evolving cultural landscape and loss of innocence in America. Central to that journey is one of the significant and influential people in Elvis‚Äôs life, Priscilla Presley (Olivia DeJonge). 

Starring alongside Butler and Hanks, award-winning theatre actress Helen Thomson (‚ÄúTop of the Lake: China Girl,‚Äù ‚ÄúRake‚Äù) plays Elvis‚Äôs mother, Gladys, Richard Roxburgh (‚ÄúMoulin Rouge!‚Äù ‚ÄúBreath,‚Äù ‚ÄúHacksaw Ridge‚Äù) portrays Elvis‚Äôs father, Vernon, and DeJonge (‚ÄúThe Visit,‚Äù ‚ÄúStray Dolls‚Äù) plays Priscilla. Luke Bracey (‚ÄúHacksaw Ridge,‚Äù ‚ÄúPoint Break‚Äù) plays Jerry Schilling, Natasha Bassett (‚ÄúHail, Caesar!‚Äù) plays Dixie Locke, David Wenham (‚ÄúThe Lord of the Rings‚Äù Trilogy, ‚ÄúLion,‚Äù ‚Äú300‚Äù) plays Hank Snow, Kelvin Harrison Jr. (‚ÄúThe Trial of the Chicago 7,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe High Note‚Äù) plays B.B. King, Xavier Samuel (‚ÄúAdore,‚Äù ‚ÄúLove & Friendship,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Twilight Saga: Eclipse‚Äù) plays Scotty Moore, and Kodi Smit-McPhee (‚ÄúThe Power of the Dog‚Äù) plays Jimmie Rodgers Snow. 

Also in the cast, Dacre Montgomery (‚ÄúStranger Things,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Broken Heart Gallery‚Äù) plays TV director Steve Binder, alongside Australian actors Leon Ford (‚ÄúGallipoli,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Pacific‚Äù) as Tom Diskin, Kate Mulvany (‚ÄúThe Great Gatsby,‚Äù ‚ÄúHunters‚Äù) as Marion Keisker, Gareth Davies (‚ÄúPeter Rabbit,‚Äù ‚ÄúHunters‚Äù) as Bones Howe, Charles Grounds (‚ÄúCrazy Rich Asians,‚Äù ‚ÄúCamp‚Äù) as Billy Smith, Josh McConville (‚ÄúFantasy Island‚Äù) as Sam Phillips, and Adam Dunn (‚ÄúHome and Away‚Äù) as Bill Black. 

To play additional iconic musical artists in the film, Luhrmann cast singer/songwriter Yola as Sister Rosetta Tharpe, model Alton Mason as Little Richard, Austin, Texas native Gary Clark Jr. as Arthur Crudup, and artist Shonka Dukureh as Willie Mae ‚ÄúBig Mama‚Äù Thornton. 

Oscar nominee Luhrmann (‚ÄúThe Great Gatsby,‚Äù ‚ÄúMoulin Rouge!‚Äù) directed from a screenplay by Baz Luhrmann & Sam Bromell and Baz Luhrmann & Craig Pearce and Jeremy Doner, story by Baz Luhrmann and Jeremy Doner.

The director‚Äôs behind-the-scenes creative team includes director of photography Mandy Walker (‚ÄúMulan,‚Äù ‚ÄúAustralia‚Äù), Oscar-winning production designer and costume designer Catherine Martin (‚ÄúThe Great Gatsby,‚Äù ‚ÄúMoulin Rouge!‚Äù), production designer Karen Murphy (‚ÄúA Star Is Born‚Äù), editors Matt Villa (‚ÄúThe Great Gatsby,‚Äù ‚ÄúAustralia‚Äù) and Jonathan Redmond (‚ÄúThe Great Gatsby‚Äù), Oscar-nominated visual effects supervisor Thomas Wood (‚ÄúMad Max: Fury Road‚Äù), music supervisor Anton Monsted (‚ÄúAustralia,‚Äù ‚ÄúMoulin Rouge!‚Äù) and composer Elliott Wheeler (‚ÄúThe Get Down‚Äù). 

Principal photography on ‚ÄúElvis‚Äù took place in Queensland, Australia with the support of the Queensland Government, Screen Queensland, and the Australian Government‚Äôs Producer Offset program.

Lyrics:
Let‚Äôs get it
Hop off a sixteen passenger
This a G5, no this not a challenger 
I keep some members with me and the freaks get coach seats
They some cannibals 
They like to get geeked, drink a whole bottle, wake up and repeat
She took a little shh mixed it with the chill out
Now she say she seeing 3D
I go in the jungle and I ain‚Äôt got a coat
I bet I come out with a mink
Do this shit for the fam, cuz this shit bigger than me
Color stones in my infinity link and in the factory masterpiece
I call him twin cuz that be my brother, we got the same Rollie he matching me
Nah for real 
 
Water on me like the sauna 
Some carets some pointers 
All these commas, I won‚Äôt fumble
Migo gunnas out the jungle 
Buy it all fuck a front up n
Can‚Äôt call me no fronter
Drop top feeling like stunner 
Can‚Äôt d play no runner we gone
Chrome heart wallet, smoke my pilot, take three vibes to the tropics
N* wasn‚Äôt shit, I was outside just servin narcotics
Claiming that stick, n made one wrong move just popped him 
Blame it on bro with the hoe flooded out in the hotel lobby 
 
Diamonds be dancing like Bobby
Don‚Äôt touch it, this glocky be cocky
Soon as G6 departed, we get it 
Bitches gone trend in the topics 
The way I pull up ima pop it and none of these n gone stop me
Put that shit on, get a cup for the drip 
I‚Äôm a mother fucking faucet
 
Keep stacking, your bank gone get bigger
Never will I throw some shade on no n* 
Lil n don‚Äôt play with these n* 
I see the big picture, we up on these n* 
The Huncho the one you gone call on these n*
I got your back you gone follow me n*
When I get up we gone ball on these n* 
Fucking shit up cause we beat out the system 
 
Water on me like the sauna 
Some carets some pointers 
All these commas, I won‚Äôt fumble
Migo gunnas out the jungle 
Buy it all fuck a front up n*
Can‚Äôt call me no fronter
Drop top feeling like stunner 
Can‚Äôt d play no runner we gone
Chrome heart wallet, smoke my pilot, take three vibes to the tropics

(Don‚Äôt tell Danny Carey.)

Dennis is known for his legendary backbeat and funky style. So of course we felt mischievous and we dared him to try playing ‚ÄúSchism‚Äù, one of Tool‚Äôs biggest songs. It‚Äôs full of odd time signatures, quick, complex changes and unexpected accents, and Dennis had never heard it before.

But we didn‚Äôt ask him to learn the real drum parts: we wanted to see what he‚Äôd come up with on his own after hearing the song once. While you‚Äôll hear the song with drums in this video, Dennis was actually listening to a drumless track.

‚ÄúThis is not me,‚Äù he warned us as he listened through the track, but ‚Äúin my younger days, this would‚Äôve been up my alley!‚Äù

How will Dennis Chambers not only learn a song he‚Äôs never heard before, but in a style he‚Äôs unfamiliar with ‚Äì and in odd time, at that?

Since the song doesn‚Äôt have a drum track, he listens for two things: the style and the time signature. Watch Dennis‚Äô playthrough where he gives it his own spin. It‚Äôs solid, it‚Äôs groovy, and there‚Äôs some unexpected footwork later on. It‚Äôs amazing how much a song can change with a different approach on the drums.

You‚Äôve never heard Schism played like this before!

If you like Dennis Chambers, he has an entire 12-lesson course on funk drumming for Drumeo members. Join today and learn from the best!

Hi Lovlies, 

My name is Judea and I am a 25 yr old Mama of 2, living in New Zealand. This Channel is a dedication to my angel baby girl, Noah-Lee. I do my best to share what our life looks like after losing our daughter to SIDS and now bringing her little brother into this world. You get a mixed bag of ‚Äúcontent‚Äù here but always from a place of honesty and through the perspective of our grief. 

Thank you so much for your support!

Sleep is so important, and I believe this remedy will help you get the sleep you need. The best natural remedy for sleep is kefir. Consume 1/2 cup of kefir before bed for better sleep. 

Kefir is similar to yogurt, but it‚Äôs better. It has more healthy, diverse microbes than yogurt. Many of these friendly microbes also survive your stomach acids, whereas the microbes in yogurt don‚Äôt.

Kefir not only has friendly bacteria but friendly yeast, too. This combination is essential. People with lactose intolerance also have an easier time digesting kefir than yogurt. 

Health benefits of kefir:
 ‚Ä¢ Decreased liver fat 
 ‚Ä¢ Fewer allergy symptoms 
 ‚Ä¢ Improved immune system 
 ‚Ä¢ Decreased inflammation 
 ‚Ä¢ Less constipation 
 ‚Ä¢ Better blood sugar 
 ‚Ä¢ Better blood pressure 
 ‚Ä¢ Decreased pathogens 

Certain microbes make serotonin. The more of the right microbes you have, the more serotonin you‚Äôll have. Serotonin is a hormone that can positively affect your mood and reduce stress. 

Kefir provides microbes that make melatonin, which is a sleep hormone. Not only that, but kefir contains microbes that make the amino acid tryptophan. Tryptophan turns into serotonin and then melatonin. 

Kefir is a good source of bioavailable calcium, which can help you get to sleep and stay asleep. The microbes in kefir also make certain B vitamins, which can greatly help with stress and calm a busy mind. The lactobacillus in kefir helps reduce cortisol, which will also help you sleep better. 

I highly recommend making your own kefir. You need something called kefir live grains (there is no grain in it) to get started. 

I like using goat milk, but you can use cow milk. The website I use to buy my kefir grains (happyherbalist.com) explains exactly how to make kefir. 

Basically, you add 1 Tbsp of the kefir grains to 1 to 2 cups of milk. Then, you set it on the counter and cover it using a cloth or paper towel and a rubber band. After 24 hours, you‚Äôll have kefir.

Welcome to Afterlife SMP, a new Minecraft SMP. A modded multiplayer 
server with friends based around the Minecraft Origins Mod
You get 10 lives in Afterlife SMP and every time you respawn you'll receive a new origin!

Due to a massive oversight on our part, we have accidentally named this series after an already existing long-running vanilla SMP called Afterlife SMP üò¨ We know this could unfortunately cause some disruption to their server and for that we are extremely sorry. 
However, I've had the joy of discovering a BUNCH of creators that are active on the original Afterlife SMP and here is a link so you too can check out the amazing stuff they're doing over on Afterlife SMP: https://streamerlinks.com/AfterLifeSMP

This was one of the hardest builds I've ever done, with challenges at every corner. Each house (SpongeBob Squarepants, Squidward Tentacles and Patrick Star) were incredibly hard to print. I'm so happy with how Bikini Bottom turned out and my sister couldn't believe the special surprise at the end! 

As you may know, Petco sells SpongeBob Squarepants' houses for fish tanks, but they are just too small. I wanted to make Bikini Bottom for a much larger fish tank so I took matters into my own hands. I used a 3D printer to make Bikini Bottom in this fish tank. PLA is both food and fish safe and great for making aquarium ornaments and parts.

It's been a busy spring for the perpetually in-demand musician - Barker recently produced Machine Gun Kelly‚Äôs latest album Mainstream Sellout (which hit #1 on the Billboard charts) and is currently in the studio working on his own label DTA Records, a joint venture with Elektra Music Group. When he decided it was time to refresh the feel of the home he‚Äôs owned for 15 years, his mother-in-law Kris Jenner suggested he reach out to Waldo Fernandez,¬†a perennial fixture on the AD100. Barker admits that the restrained vibe he arrived at is a bit of a departure from some of his previous residences. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve had homes with lots of flashy cars, murals, and bikes hanging from the ceiling. But with three children of my own, plus Kourtney‚Äôs kids, this place felt right for this moment in my life.""

It's been a busy spring for the perpetually in-demand musician - Barker recently produced Machine Gun Kelly‚Äôs latest album Mainstream Sellout (which hit #1 on the Billboard charts) and is currently in the studio working on his own label DTA Records, a joint venture with Elektra Music Group. When he decided it was time to refresh the feel of the home he‚Äôs owned for 15 years, his mother-in-law Kris Jenner suggested he reach out to Waldo Fernandez,¬†a perennial fixture on the AD100. Barker admits that the restrained vibe he arrived at is a bit of a departure from some of his previous residences. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve had homes with lots of flashy cars, murals, and bikes hanging from the ceiling. But with three children of my own, plus Kourtney‚Äôs kids, this place felt right for this moment in my life.""

‚ñ∫Official ‚ÄúCooped Up‚Äù Lyrics:

I‚Äôm about to pull up
Hit switch, pull curtain
And I‚Äôve been waitin‚Äô so long
Now I gotta re-surface
 
And yeah we bout to toast up,
All that bread that we burnin‚Äô
Cuz I‚Äôve been feelin‚Äô cooped up
I‚Äôve been fuckin‚Äô cooped up
 
Yeah I‚Äôm off the Bud Light not the bourbon
I might chop the roof off the Suburban
Tried to Bia Nice Guy, John Terzian
Til‚Äô I started throwin‚Äô up in your Birkin
 
Then I woke up in the mornin‚Äô
Police showed up at my door with a warrant
I remember flushin‚Äô somethin‚Äô down the toilet
Guess you gotta let me off with with a warning, Return Of Mack
 
Feelin‚Äô like an Outkast
I‚Äôm the only guy in slacks, that‚Äôll cost ya three stacks
Now you savin‚Äô that check
Why you takin‚Äô my swag can you give me that back
 
Gucci my Prada, Miyake
Louie, Bottega, and Tommy
All of these things on my body
Let‚Äôs party
 
I‚Äôm about to pull up
Hit switch, pull curtain
And I‚Äôve been waitin‚Äô so long
Now I gotta re-surface
 
And yeah we bout to toast up,
All that bread that we burnin‚Äô
Cuz I‚Äôve been feelin‚Äô cooped up
I‚Äôve been fuckin‚Äô cooped up
 
Shit, gotta pull up, pull up, Ima pull up, I pull up
Got black minx all on the rug
Got hella hoes popping drugs
In every hood they show us love
Partner in crime with me while we whipping in the space ship
Got out the pavement, now we getting payment
Everybody around me getting money, it's too contagious
Kept it solid now we real rich to they amazement
I pulled up the black Badge cause it was cleaner
I remember I was just posted up with the demons
And Posty took me on my first damn tour dates
He had me rocking every night sold out arenas
A project n***a I never thought I would see shit
Or try to tell you, you probably wouldn‚Äôt believe us
 
I‚Äôm about to pull up
Hit switch, pull curtain
And I‚Äôve been waitin‚Äô so long
Now I gotta re-surface

‚ñ∫Official ‚ÄúCooped Up‚Äù Lyrics:

I‚Äôm about to pull up
Hit switch, pull curtain
And I‚Äôve been waitin‚Äô so long
Now I gotta re-surface
 
And yeah we bout to toast up,
All that bread that we burnin‚Äô
Cuz I‚Äôve been feelin‚Äô cooped up
I‚Äôve been fuckin‚Äô cooped up
 
Yeah I‚Äôm off the Bud Light not the bourbon
I might chop the roof off the Suburban
Tried to Bia Nice Guy, John Terzian
Til‚Äô I started throwin‚Äô up in your Birkin
 
Then I woke up in the mornin‚Äô
Police showed up at my door with a warrant
I remember flushin‚Äô somethin‚Äô down the toilet
Guess you gotta let me off with with a warning, Return Of Mack
 
Feelin‚Äô like an Outkast
I‚Äôm the only guy in slacks, that‚Äôll cost ya three stacks
Now you savin‚Äô that check
Why you takin‚Äô my swag can you give me that back
 
Gucci my Prada, Miyake
Louie, Bottega, and Tommy
All of these things on my body
Let‚Äôs party
 
I‚Äôm about to pull up
Hit switch, pull curtain
And I‚Äôve been waitin‚Äô so long
Now I gotta re-surface
 
And yeah we bout to toast up,
All that bread that we burnin‚Äô
Cuz I‚Äôve been feelin‚Äô cooped up
I‚Äôve been fuckin‚Äô cooped up
 
Shit, gotta pull up, pull up, Ima pull up, I pull up
Got black minx all on the rug
Got hella hoes popping drugs
In every hood they show us love
Partner in crime with me while we whipping in the space ship
Got out the pavement, now we getting payment
Everybody around me getting money, it's too contagious
Kept it solid now we real rich to they amazement
I pulled up the black Badge cause it was cleaner
I remember I was just posted up with the demons
And Posty took me on my first damn tour dates
He had me rocking every night sold out arenas
A project n***a I never thought I would see shit
Or try to tell you, you probably wouldn‚Äôt believe us
 
I‚Äôm about to pull up
Hit switch, pull curtain
And I‚Äôve been waitin‚Äô so long
Now I gotta re-surface
 
And yeah we bout to toast up,
All that bread that we burnin‚Äô
Cuz I‚Äôve been feelin‚Äô cooped up
I‚Äôve been fuckin‚Äô cooped up
 
Til‚Äô the daylight come
Til‚Äô the daylight come
I got Sak√© in my tummy, cigarette in my lungs
It‚Äôs Eleven in the mornin‚Äô and we still ain‚Äôt done
And I‚Äôm still that bitch, so what
 
Yeah we bout to toast up,
All this bread that we burnin‚Äô

Look around you. Where are you? Where is this place you are occupying? Somewhere in a room, maybe in a city on a continent on a planet orbiting a star in a galaxy among billions. But‚Ä¶ where is all of that? While this may feel like a daft question, it turns out that the concept of an absolute position is something humans made up. 

In a nutshell, the universe is a big bag of space that has things in it. If someone removed all these things, the stars and planets and black holes and dust, there would just be empty space left. In empty space, the concept of having a position loses all meaning. Empty space is uniform, the same everywhere.

I‚Äôve collected Pokemon cards all my life, but have never made a YouTube video about it. I also have a history of making the biggest and best builds on YouTube so this week I decided to combine my passions and build giant First Edition Pokemon Cards and surprise some the biggest creators on the planet with them. This video had lots of ups and downs becuase we needed to finish them so quickly, but we figured it all out and they turned out incredible! It was amazing to meet and surprise the biggest creators on YouTube! Shoutout to @FaZe Rug , @MARKO , @Bryce Hall , @Ben Azelart , and @Cam Huff  for being involved! This was insane and super intense to make, but we had lots of laughs along the way. I love making these videos and can't wait for you to see what is next.

H-iM_JhNzIQ,2022-05-16T01:26:28Z,UCbAwSkqJ1W_Eg7wr3cp5BUA,I Got My Scalp Professionally Cleaned,"Hello friends & welcome to my scalp! In this episode, I try something I've been wanting to try for literal months - a professional scalp exfoliation!! As some of you may know, I do like to delve into different algorithmic rabbit holes on good ole' YouTube, and recently, YouTube has been showing me a lot of ASMR Head Spa videos, where ASMRtists get their scalps professionally cleaned to unclog their hair follicles and promote healthy hair & regrowth. And so, I decided to venture to the Blow Me Away Salon in LA to get a Japanese Head Spa treatment, and finally give my head the spa day it deserves. What do you guys think? Would you try something like this?

Apologies if my scalp is too disturbing, lol. 

Also - just a heads up, there *are* other contributing factors to dandruff besides just dirty scalp - I think in my case, I just have a lot of buildup, and Arisa zeroed in on that in relation to my particular head. Also also - in terms of maintaining your scalp care at home, Arisa just mentioned using specific scalp cleansing products & serums about once a week! 

Also also - I noticed that some of you guys are skeptical about some of the ingredients of the products & the treatment as a whole - totally fair for you guys to have criticisms about it, I wasn't trying to vouch for every individual ingredient, or for how effective this would be for everybody - I personally enjoyed it, and I just thought it would be interesting to know what they say are the active ingredients. I'll be sure to keep your thoughts in mind for next time we make a video in this arena.

We decided to call this series Minecraft Manhunt. This video is a different rendition of it, where there is a SPY instead of just a normal speedrunner.

This is a new Minecraft but, 1.16 challenge that we have decided to try. I try to beat the game, while my friend Dream tries to prevent me from doing it. It's a race, and it's super intense and we had a lot of laughs. I love doing these challenges.

If this video gets 1,000,000 likes we'll do something crazier.

Not Minecraft, But Water Rises or Minecraft, But Lava Rises, or any other but challenge like that. This is a speed run / speed runner of Minecraft against a killer / assassin

Roblox Bee Swarm simulator is a classic Roblox simulator game where you walk around with your bees to collect pollen and honey so you can get better equipment to get pollen and honey faster.

Like all the other Roblox simulator games, the objective is to get STRONG and RICH. To get from noob to pro, the player needs to buy more bees, improve their bee hive, buy better equipment, complete quests, kill mobs, complete challenges, and use codes to get some items. The better stuff the player gets, the more honey and pollen they will gather. The game is very grindy, just like all other simulators, and most people would use macros or scripts to farm.

There are 45 types of bees, and they all have different stats and abilities. Since the maximum number of bees a player can have is 50, they need to find the best hive build (combination of bees) to get honey fast. Rarer bees are usually higher on the tier list, and some, like the windy bee, are hard to obtain.

On top of bees, people need to grind for equipment and items like Tide Popper, Dark Scythe, Gummyballer, translator, and The Planter Of Plenty to farm more efficiently. They let the player gather more pollen, unlock new quests and drop better stuff.

This video will show you everything there is to the game. It is not a complete guide, but there are some tips you can follow to get more honey. 

Like always, this video is filled with a crap ton of dead memes in the form of funny moments/montages. Bee Swarm Simulator used to have events like the Christmas 2021 event with snowflakes and gingerbread bears, but since then, there has been no update. I hope you enjoyed this Bee Swarm Simulator video. Don‚Äôt forget to subscribe and spam E.

d_b06F3DXQY,2022-05-16T21:00:02Z,UCJDIGW0ywWw9Kh9_vtwqxXA,"NATO, Finland, Sweden, and Russia's Domino Theory Dilemma","Check out my books on Amazon (paid link): https://amzn.to/2SiQjlp

Vladimir Putin claims that Russia invaded Ukraine to halt the eastward expansion of the NATO alliance. Three months into the war, Putin has misplayed his hand right into his alleged fear, as Finland and Sweden look set to join it.

This video examines Putin's execution of ""domino theory"" doctrine---the idea that failing to stop one threat leads to more threats down the line. Often absent from domino theory discussions is the fact that fighting wars weakens your military capacity to win other conflicts later. Thus, fighting for reputation creates a dilemma, and perhaps one that Putin poorly navigated this time around.

Vladimir Putin claims that Russia invaded Ukraine to halt the eastward expansion of the NATO alliance. Three months into the war, Putin has misplayed his hand right into his alleged fear, as Finland and Sweden look set to join it.

This video examines Putin's execution of ""domino theory"" doctrine---the idea that failing to stop one threat leads to more threats down the line. Often absent from domino theory discussions is the fact that fighting wars weakens your military capacity to win other conflicts later. Thus, fighting for reputation creates a dilemma, and perhaps one that Putin poorly navigated this time around.

‚ÄúPrey,‚Äù an all-new action-thriller from 20th Century Studios directed by Dan Trachtenberg (‚ÄúThe Boys,‚Äù ‚Äú10 Cloverfield Lane‚Äù) and the newest entry in the ‚ÄúPredator‚Äù franchise, will stream August 5, 2022, exclusively on Hulu.
 
Set in the Comanche Nation 300 years ago, ‚ÄúPrey‚Äù is the story of a young woman, Naru, a fierce and highly skilled warrior. She has been raised in the shadow of some of the most legendary hunters who roam the Great Plains, so when danger threatens her camp, she sets out to protect her people. The prey she stalks, and ultimately confronts, turns out to be a highly evolved alien predator with a technically advanced arsenal, resulting in a vicious and terrifying showdown between the two adversaries.
 
‚ÄúPrey‚Äù is directed by Dan Trachtenberg, written by Patrick Aison (‚ÄúJack Ryan,‚Äù ‚ÄúTreadstone‚Äù), and produced by John Davis (‚ÄúJungle Cruise,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Predator‚Äù) and Jhane Myers (‚ÄúMonsters of God‚Äù), with Lawrence Gordon (‚ÄúWatchmen‚Äù), Marty Ewing (‚ÄúIt: Chapter Two‚Äù), James E. Thomas, John C. Thomas and Marc Toberoff (‚ÄúFantasy Island‚Äù) serving as executive producers.
 
The filmmakers were committed to creating a film that provides an accurate portrayal of the Comanche and brings a level of authenticity that rings true to its Indigenous peoples. Myers, an acclaimed filmmaker, Sundance Fellow and member of the Comanche nation herself, is known for her attention and dedication to films surrounding the Comanche and Blackfeet nations and her passion for honoring the legacies of the Native communities. As a result, the film features a cast comprised almost entirely of Native and First Nation‚Äôs talent, including Amber Midthunder (‚ÄúThe Ice Road,‚Äù ‚ÄúRoswell, New Mexico‚Äù), newcomer Dakota Beavers, Stormee Kipp (‚ÄúSooyii‚Äù), Michelle Thrush (‚ÄúThe Journey Home‚Äù), Julian Black Antelope (‚ÄúTribal‚Äù).",20th Century Studios,['Trailer'],1,none,Prey | 20th Century Studios | Hulu,"Prey is coming to Hulu August 5

Lyric‚ô´

[Intro: JM14]
(Imma put this shit in cruise control)
Imma (put this shit in cruise control)

[Verse 1: JM14]
Ay, Imma put this shit in cruise control
Ill pour me a double cup
New year new me, Ima put it down
But i think of V and i double up
I see OP's while pulling up
(So let me put that shit in cruise control)
Fucking Spenny pass the smoke
Lets show them boys whos in control
Don't tell me bout them do's or don'ts
They slip they copping lead
Fuck that I heard bout what they said
Keep spinning back till somethings dead
No options here we're tagging toes
If you go missing no one knows
I guess that answers the question
To why we get no fucking shows
That's why I put that shit in cruise control (Ay, Gang)
Clock that back and watch him los–µ his soul

[Verse 1: YP14]
Straight from that yard
I can't chill I'm in that field out on parole
I told JM don't get m–µ no strippers
Bro I want a pole
What's with that side all holding hands and shit
Like this shit getting old
Cross that line, I don't care bout who he is
He paid a toll
All I hear is cap so lets bring back the facts
I'm still smoking that Tino pack
Bro what is this, how good is this
???
Still with them shooters they ain't thinking twice
Bro gone let it slap
They don't care bout where they at
They just care bout getting back

[Verse 1: Spenny14]
???
Get me tipsy for ??
Them boys some 60s turn them Ricky
When I'm reaching for my heat
Been in a pub with all the crims
So you can say I'm in the mix
I'm like a camera man the way that I be shooting all these clips
So I just put that Glock in cruise control
Clean it up and get it sold
We don't play no games round here
Boy this shit ain't no Super Bowl
Come through like your stick
And we gone have your family digging holes
No I can not slip ??? poke
I can not ever fold

[Chorus: JM14]
That's why I put that shit in cruise control
Clock that back and watch him lose his soul
That's why I put that shit in cruise control
Time to show that side whos in control

Putin‚Äôs critics and supporters are fiercely divided. The conflict came to a head on May 9, which marked 77 years since Nazi Germany's surrender.

Barricades, strict regulations, and thousands of police on duty: German authorities predicted May 9 would get heated. Commemorated as ""Victory Day‚Äù in many former Soviet countries, the date marks 77 years since the surrender of Nazi Germany. But due to the war in Ukraine, the occasion took on a whole new meaning. The divide between Putin‚Äôs opponents and supporters was brought into sharp focus. Authorities banned the display of Russian and Ukrainian flags in the hopes of avoiding escalation. But emotions were running high at dueling protests, with demonstrators breaking out in verbal confrontations over Russia‚Äôs war in Ukraine. DW reporter Oxana Evdokimova shows the divisions in the Russian-speaking community in Berlin and why many Russians in Germany support Putin and the military aggression in Ukraine.

tNZ30cLKMno,2022-05-16T04:01:27Z,UCLgEVx4mzk3T3mzgbKG54Eg,How fast is the new $50k Nissan Z? ‚Äî New Z vs Supra vs Mustang Mach-1 ‚Äî Cammisa's Drag Race Replay,"The 2023 Nissan Z has a 400-hp twin-turbo V-6. It's roughly the same price as the Ford Mustang GT 5.0 and Toyota Supra, so let's answer the $50,000 question: Which one makes it through the quarter-mile first?

The 2023 Z Sport starts at $41,015 (with destination) but this is the $51,015 Z Performance, which comes with wider tires and a limited-slip differential. It's likely that the base car will be slower due to the rear-wheel traction differential.

For the first race, with Jason Cammisa's now-iconic frozen-time slow-mo walkback, we have the 2023 Nissan Z with a 9-speed automatic transmission battling a 10-speed Ford Mustang Mach-1 and an 8-speed Toyota GR Supra 3.0.

Instrumented Testing Results are as follows:
1. 2022 Ford Mustang Mach-1 (automatic)
 0-60 mph = 3.8 sec
 1/4 mile = 12.1 sec @ 120 mph

2. 2022 Toyota GR Supra 3.0
 0-60 mph = 3.8 sec
 1/4 mile = 12.1 sec @ 117 mph

3. 2023 Nissan Z (Performance package) (automatic)
 0-60 mph = 4.0 sec
 1/4 mile = 12.3 sec @ 116 mph

For the second race, we have the 9-speed automatic Z versus the Z 6-speed manual.

Instrumented Testing Results are as follows:
1. 2023 Nissan Z (Performance package) (automatic)
 0-60 mph = 4.0 sec
 1/4 mile = 12.3 sec @ 116 mph

2. 2023 Nissan Z (Performance package) (6MT)
 0-60 mph = 4.3 sec
 1/4 mile = 12.8 sec @ 112 mph


And for the bonus round, we have a 2010 Aston Martin V8 Vantage 4.7, which is almost exactly the same size, weight, horsepower, and torque as the New Z. 

1. 2010 Aston Martin V8 Vantage 4.7 6-speed manual
 0-60 mph = 4.4 sec
 1/4 mile = 12.7 @ 112 mph

2. 2023 Nissan Z (Performance package) (6MT)
 0-60 mph = 4.3 sec
 1/4 mile = 12.8 sec @ 112 mph

Please be sure to watch the full episode for Jason's explanation of why the Z didn't quite keep up, and why the manual-transmission Z is quieter than the automatic.

It's roughly the same price as the Ford Mustang GT 5.0 and Toyota Supra, so let's answer the $50,000 question: Which one makes it through the quarter-mile first?

The 2023 Z Sport starts at $41,015 (with destination) but this is the $51,015 Z Performance, which comes with wider tires and a limited-slip differential. It's likely that the base car will be slower due to the rear-wheel traction differential.

For the first race, with Jason Cammisa's now-iconic frozen-time slow-mo walkback, we have the 2023 Nissan Z with a 9-speed automatic transmission battling a 10-speed Ford Mustang Mach-1 and an 8-speed Toyota GR Supra 3.0.

Instrumented Testing Results are as follows:
1. 2022 Ford Mustang Mach-1 (automatic)
 0-60 mph = 3.8 sec
 1/4 mile = 12.1 sec @ 120 mph

2. 2022 Toyota GR Supra 3.0
 0-60 mph = 3.8 sec
 1/4 mile = 12.1 sec @ 117 mph

3. 2023 Nissan Z (Performance package) (automatic)
 0-60 mph = 4.0 sec
 1/4 mile = 12.3 sec @ 116 mph

For the second race, we have the 9-speed automatic Z versus the Z 6-speed manual.

Instrumented Testing Results are as follows:
1. 2023 Nissan Z (Performance package) (automatic)
 0-60 mph = 4.0 sec
 1/4 mile = 12.3 sec @ 116 mph

2. 2023 Nissan Z (Performance package) (6MT)
 0-60 mph = 4.3 sec
 1/4 mile = 12.8 sec @ 112 mph


And for the bonus round, we have a 2010 Aston Martin V8 Vantage 4.7, which is almost exactly the same size, weight, horsepower, and torque as the New Z. 

1. 2010 Aston Martin V8 Vantage 4.7 6-speed manual
 0-60 mph = 4.4 sec
 1/4 mile = 12.7 @ 112 mph

2. 2023 Nissan Z (Performance package) (6MT)
 0-60 mph = 4.3 sec
 1/4 mile = 12.8 sec @ 112 mph

Please be sure to watch the full episode for Jason's explanation of why the Z didn't quite keep up, and why the manual-transmission Z is quieter than the automatic.

fpQcS2_bzZA,2022-05-15T09:30:06Z,UCWXYAGB9SadlL6p5Bb66wWw,"Charlo vs Castano 2 HIGHLIGHTS: May 14, 2022 | PBC on Showtime","(May 14, 2022) In a history-making performance, Jermell Charlo again showed he‚Äôs the master of the rematch. Unified WBC, WBA and IBF World Champion Jermell Charlo picked up the WBO title with a dramatic 10th-round KO of Brian Casta√±o in a rematch of  their 2021 masterpiece to become the first ever undisputed male 154-pound champion in the four-belt era on Saturday, May 14 live on SHOWTIME from Dignity Health Sports Park in Carson. The bout, which was another Fight of the Year-type encounter, headlined a Premier Boxing Champions event before an announced crowd of 7,406.  
 
The end came when Charlo (35-1-1, 18 KOs) dropped Casta√±o with a short, left hook as he was fighting off the ropes with around a minute left in the 10th. Casta√±o (17-1-2, 12 KOs) rose on unsteady legs and was allowed to continue and Charlo jumped on him, landing a vicious left to the head and body that caused Casta√±o to collapse and referee Jerry Cantu to wave off the bout at 2:33 of the 10th.
 
Saturday‚Äôs ending was reminiscent of the way Charlo closed his fight with Tony Harrison in their 2019 rematch when he KO‚Äôd Harrison in the 11th round after Harrison dethroned him in 2018.
 
Charlo, 31, is trained by Derrick James, who helped orchestrate Errol Spence Jr.‚Äôs 10th-round stoppage of Yordenis Ugas to pick up a third welterweight title on April 16 from AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas.
 
Charlo and Casta√±o went toe-to-toe for 12 grueling rounds the first time they fought on July 17, 2021 on SHOWTIME, with the back-and-forth tilt ending in a split-decision draw. Charlo didn‚Äôt leave it in the judges‚Äô hands on Saturday. 
 
‚ÄúThis is legacy,‚Äù Charlo said in the ring afterward. ‚ÄúThis is something that is legendary. I‚Äôm a legend. I knew Casta√±o was going to give it his all. I knew I had trained very, very hard but you all can see that I came in at 152 pounds because I was really in shape, and I wanted to make sure that this was my fight.‚Äù

The rematch was previously announced to take place on March 19 but was rescheduled after Casta√±o suffered an arm injury in training. The delay angered Charlo, who accused Casta√±o of gamesmanship in the run-up.
 

But the two shook hands and praised the other‚Äôs tenacity on Saturday after sharing the ring for a combined 22 rounds.

‚ÄúWe showed that we are warriors,‚Äù Casta√±o said. ‚ÄúWe both were fighting back-and-forth. He‚Äôs a champion. He hit me. He got me. But I‚Äôm okay.‚Äù

Charlo produced a calm, clinically efficient and ultimately punishing performance. Expecting Casta√±o to fight aggressively and apply pressure, Charlo boxed effectively off his back foot, utilizing a hard jab and a counter-left that repeatedly found its target, none more violently than the final moments of the match. 
 
Just like the first match, Casta√±o again landed a number of overhand rights and was successful in spots with his constant pressure. The fight was again fought at a torrid pace with both fighters hurting the other. But just like in the first fight, when Charlo gathered strength as the fight went on and won the final three rounds on all the judges‚Äô scorecards, Charlo again wrested control of the bout in the late stages on Saturday.
 
‚ÄúI listened to my corner this time,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI got in my bag around the seventh round. I started sitting down a little bit more instead of boxing so much and moving around. I saw that he was wearing down a little bit and I was breaking him down. I just saw my punches being more effective. I get stronger in the later rounds if they didn‚Äôt know.‚Äù

On December 21, 2021, I was diagnosed with stage 3 breast cancer after months of appointments, biopsies, and misinformation. Since then I have shared my healing journey in the hopes that I may help that one person out there who is navigating a challenging time and feels alone. 

Back when we first met with our oncologist, 16 weeks of chemotherapy sounded like a mountain I wasn't sure I was strong enough to climb. And while it has certainly been the hardest months of our lives I now know that I was given this mountain to show others it CAN be moved. 

Thank you for making this a safe space for me to share such news in an open conversation, with no filters. We love you.

#ChilteyRoud is an ode to the loved ones. No matter where or who we are, the deep blue sky speaks to us just the same. The same sky that bestows shade over the arable soils of the village, also brings relief over the busy streets of a metro-city. The language of love and yearning for the loved ones is universal.
 
This is where the urban lyrical picturization of ‚ÄúChiltey Rodey‚Äù by Arnob entwines with the famous rural tunes of Bhawaiya song ‚ÄúO Ki Ekbar Ashiya‚Äù by Abbasuddin Ahmed to express the same deep emotion and hunger in our hearts to be close and in the presence of love. The soulful voices of Arnob and Ripon (Boga) pay tribute to the Real Magic of reminiscing which binds us all in a single thread of togetherness.
